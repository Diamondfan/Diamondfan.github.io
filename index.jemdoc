== Bio 
Ruchao Fan is currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, at UCLA. He works with [https://www.ee.ucla.edu/abeer-alwan Prof. Abeer Alwan] on problems of speech processing.
His current work focuses on children's speech recognition from a low-resource perspective and end-to-end speech recognition. Prior to that, He received his Master's and Bachelor's degree
from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) in 2019 and 2016, respectively.

Ruchao has interned at Sogou Inc. (2018-2019), PAII Inc. (2020), and Microsoft Corporation (2021, 2022), doing research on speech recognition. He was awarded UCLA-Amazon Fellowship in 2022, and was honored as Amazon Fellow.
